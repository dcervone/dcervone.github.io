	<h1>Dan Cervone</h1>
	<p> I'm a Senior Analyst in Research and Development with the <font color="#1e90ff">Los Angeles Dodgers</font>. Prior to this, I was a <a href="http://cds.nyu.edu/mooresloan/">Moore-Sloan Data Science Fellow</a> at New York University. In 2015, I completed a PhD in <a title="Harvard Statistics Department" href="http://statistics.fas.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">Statistics at Harvard University</a>. My work focuses on spatiotemporal data and hierarchical models, with particular application to sports analytics and player tracking data. Previously, I interned as a statistician with the Quantitative Marketing group at Google and worked as a research assistant at the UChicago Booth School of Business. As an undergraduate, I studied Math and Statistics at the University of Chicago.</p>
