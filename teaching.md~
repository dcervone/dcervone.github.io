Statistics is a powerful, fascinating, and elegant science and I enjoy sharing this with others through teaching. During 2013-14 I was a [Departmental Teaching Fellow](http://bokcenter.harvard.edu/icb/icb.do?keyword=k1985&amp;pageid=icb.page29734) Departmental Teaching Fellow at Harvard. Prior to that, I served as a Teaching Fellow for several levels of introductory statistics, linear models, and a tutorial for Statistics concentrators.
